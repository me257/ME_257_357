function Thrust = realTurbofanThrust(UInf, altitude, engine, fluid)
    % function: realTurbofanThrust
    % --------------------------------------------------------------------
    % This function computes the thrust of the real turbofan
    %   Inputs:
    %       UInf = vector of freestream velocities. [m/s]
    %       altitude = the altitude. [m].
    %       engine = structure containing the engine parameters
    %       fluid = structure containing the fluid parameters
    %   Outputs:
    %       Thrust = vector of the thrust produced by the engine. [N]
